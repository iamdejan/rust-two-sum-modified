[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iamdejan/rust-two-sum-modified.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iamdejan/rust-two-sum-modified)

This repository contains my solution from modified "Two Sum" problem.

## Original Problem Statement

Source: [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

```
Given an array of integers,
return indices of the two numbers
such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,
and you may not use the same element twice.
```

## Modified Problem Statement

```
Given an array of integers, return all pairs
such that they add up to a specific target.

You may not use the same element twice.
```
